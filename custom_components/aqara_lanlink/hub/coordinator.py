"""LANLink session coordinator.

Owns the long-running loop that keeps a LANLink session alive against an
Aqara hub:
    1. open EncryptedTunnel
    2. send checkin
    3. listen for reports, dispatching each to handlers registered
       via ``register_report_handler`` keyed by sub-device DID
    4. on any error/close, backoff and reconnect

Designed to be started once from `async_setup_entry` and stopped on unload.
The hub's actual idle timeout is generous once the cloud user/token pair has
been verified, so this just needs to be robust against transient TCP issues,
hub restarts, and token/credential rotation.

        reports a non-zero code.

        Wire framing is determined by ``parent_did``, the device's actual
        parent hub in the cluster (which is NOT necessarily the hub we
        connected to -- a child of a peer hub still routes through our

          parent_did``, ``data.sdid = did``, ``data.model = model``.
          Critically, this is what the Aqara mobile app sends -- the
          target device's parent is the routing key, not the hub we're

          on 2026-05-09: phone writes with did=M100, sdid=bulb,
          model=bulb_model when bulb's parent is M100, and these writes
          actuate; without the correct parent_did the hub returns
          ``code=0, result=null`` and the device silently no-ops.)

        Backwards compatibility: when ``parent_did`` is ``None`` (the
        default), the coordinator falls back to the prior behaviour --
        treating ``did == hub_we_connected_to`` as hub-scoped and any
        other ``did`` as a child of the connected hub. Callers that know
        the device's actual parent in the cluster should pass
        ``parent_did`` explicitly so cross-cluster routing works.
